# Problem 1 - POTATO PAT0TA

**Description:**

Our very own, one of a kind AT0TA of TheALTF4Stream has been captured by aliens! And even worse, they've started cloning him!

Lucky for us, all the clones are clearly mistaken - they all have random numbers instead of the iconic AT0TA `0`!

Find out just how bad they screwed up - sum all the numbers hiding in their names to bring us back to our perfect `0`.



**Input**:

File `input.txt` containing one clone name per line in the format `AT#TA`

`#` can be an integer of up to 4 digits

**Expected Output:**

Print the **sum** of all the hidden numbers in all the clone names

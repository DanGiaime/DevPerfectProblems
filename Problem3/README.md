# Problem 3 - I'm A Squat Rack Guy Now

**Description:**

Bro, do you lift? Me neither. But more importantly, do you **SQUAT?!?**. Bro, sick, same. What's your max? Oh, you wanna know Melkey's max squat? MELKEY'S squat bro? Bro it's huge. Like so much. There's so many plates on the bar, you'd never believe how much Melkey is squatting.

...Actually bro, I have no idea.
There's a bunch of different plates on the barbell, but bro I'm gonna be real, I can't count them. Growing up I never learned how to count, just how to squat... I don't know how much Melkey's squatting...

Given a list of squats (represented as a list of plate weights), figure out Melkey's max squat (it's a lot, probably).

**Input**:

File `input.txt` containing one squat per line.
Each squat is represented as a comma-separated list of plate weights E.x. `WEIGHT1,WEIGHT2,WEIGHT3`
**The sum of all plates is the total weight of that squat.**

**Expected Output:**

Print the **max total weight** of a single squat. (Print the max single-line sum)

# CHALLENGE ROUND - Containerization Orchestration Complication Causes Conflagration

**Description:**

The only thing more complicated than working with containers is talking about them. Especially when blackglasses is explaining them.

In fact, software developers are some of the laziest typers in the world. Kubernetes? Try k8s. Internationalization? Try i18n. Accessibility? More like a11y.

As developers, it is our sole purpose to force everyone else to try and understand our lingo. Let's take some transformed regular english words, and see if we can figure out which one is the most annoying.

From `input.txt`, find the longest shortened word. From `dictionary.txt`, figure out what the word actually is and output it.

**Input**:

File `input.txt` containing one shortened word per line (Ex: `d12n`).
File `dictionary.txt` containing many long words, one word per line (ex: `defenestration`).

​	**IMPORTANT NOTE: **

​	You cannot just look at `dictionary.txt`, it will have random extra long words to prevent you from doing that ;)
​	First find the longest word represented in `input.txt`, then find a matching word in `dictionary.txt`.

**Expected Output:**

Print the **actual longest word**. 

-----

**Example Input:**
`input.txt`:

```
k8s
d12n
```

`dictionary.txt`:

```
kubernetes
internationalization
spaghetti
defenestration
```

**Example Output:**

`defenestration`

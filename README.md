# DevPerfect Competition

**Before the competition starts:**

* Git clone this repo
* Do NOT open any of the problem folders



**Rules**

Before each round, the problem will be read aloud on stream and in Discord. During this time, you may read the problem yourself or look up any functions/documentation you may not remember (e.x. how to read a file).

Each round is 10 minutes long.

You have that long and not a moment longer to complete the problem with the given inputs, **blindfolded.**

Your output must match the **Competition Output**. NOT the Example Output. Example Outputs are provided for reference only.

After a single attempt, you may remove your blindfold, navigate to your terminal, and run your code.

1. If you do not get the desired outcome, you may look at your code for as long as you like.

2. Then, **you must move your cursor back to 0,0, the beginning of the top line of your code file.**

3. Place your blindfold back on, and start on your next attempt.
   * Every time you take your blindfold off, that is one attempt.

At the end of four rounds, a winner will be announced.



**Points**

1. Points awarded 1st - 4th as 50, 40, 30, 20 multiplied by round (1 based round system) respectively 
2. Each unsuccessful try costs 4 * round (yes you can be negative) 
3. Unsuccessful finishing of problem costs 10 * round (yes you can be negative).
4. Specifically during the challenge round, tries and unsuccessful finishes incur no penalties. The challenge round exclusively results in additional points, no negatives.



**Prizes**

**1st place**: 5 gift subs in your channel from all other competitors

**2nd place**: Nothing. Congrats, you didn't lose _that much_.

**3rd + 4th place**: Competitors must use Emacs for an entire stream after the competition is over.
